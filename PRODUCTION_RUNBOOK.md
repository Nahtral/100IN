# 100IN Basketball Management System - Production Runbook

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### Prerequisites
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, E2E)
- [ ] Security linter clean (0 errors)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Database migrations reviewed and tested

### Step-by-Step Deployment

1. **Create Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   ```

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Checks**
   - Lint and type checking
   - Unit tests
   - Database security scan
   - E2E tests on staging
   - Performance benchmarks

3. **Manual Approval**
   - Code review by team lead
   - Security review for sensitive changes
   - Performance impact assessment

4. **Production Deployment**
   - Automated deployment via GitHub Actions
   - Health checks and smoke tests
   - Rollback if any checks fail

## üîÑ Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Health check failures (2 consecutive failures)
- Error rate > 5% for 5 minutes
- Response time > 2 seconds average for 5 minutes
- Database connection failures

### Manual Rollback
```bash
# Emergency rollback to previous version
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or restore from backup
kubectl rollout undo deployment/100in-app
```

## üìä Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Performance**: Response time < 200ms average
- **Reliability**: Error rate < 1%
- **Availability**: Uptime > 99.9%
- **User Experience**: Core flows completion rate > 95%

### Critical Alerts
1. **Database Issues**
   - Connection pool exhaustion
   - Query timeout > 5 seconds
   - Failed migrations

2. **Authentication Problems**
   - Login failure rate > 10%
   - Session timeout issues
   - Permission denied errors

3. **Core Feature Failures**
   - Attendance save failures
   - User approval process errors
   - Real-time grade updates failing

### Alert Channels
- **Critical**: Immediate SMS/call
- **High**: Slack #alerts channel
- **Medium**: Email notification
- **Low**: Dashboard only

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Cannot read properties of null" Errors
```bash
# Check React hook usage
grep -r "useState" src/ | grep -v "React.useState"

# Fix: Ensure React import or use hook properly
```

#### 2. Database Connection Issues
```sql
-- Check connection count
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;

-- Check for locks
SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE NOT granted;
```

#### 3. Authentication Flow Problems
- Verify Supabase URL configuration
- Check RLS policies for conflicts
- Validate user profile creation triggers

#### 4. Performance Degradation
```bash
# Check bundle size
npm run build
npx bundlesize

# Analyze performance
npm run analyze
```
