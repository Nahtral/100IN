```

### 2. Supabase Configuration
```sql
-- Final production settings
UPDATE auth.config SET 
  site_url = 'https://yourdomain.com',
  uri_allow_list = '{"https://yourdomain.com"}';

-- Enable email confirmations in production
UPDATE auth.config SET 
  enable_signup = true,
  enable_email_confirmations = true;
```

### 3. Domain Configuration
1. **DNS Records** (Configure with your domain provider):
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: @
   Value: [provided by Lovable]
   
   Type: CNAME  
   Name: www
   Value: [provided by Lovable]
   ```

2. **SSL Certificate**: Automatically provisioned by Lovable

## üîß Maintenance Procedures

### Daily Monitoring
- [ ] Check application health dashboard
- [ ] Monitor error rates and performance metrics
- [ ] Review user feedback and support tickets
- [ ] Verify backup completion

### Weekly Tasks
- [ ] Review security logs for anomalies
- [ ] Check database performance metrics
- [ ] Update documentation as needed
- [ ] Review and rotate access logs

### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] Security audit review
- [ ] Performance optimization review
- [ ] Backup restoration test
- [ ] Dependency updates and security patches
- [ ] User access review and cleanup

## üìä Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Application Performance**
   - Response times (< 2s for 95th percentile)
   - Error rates (< 1%)
   - Uptime (> 99.9%)

2. **Database Performance**
   - Query performance
   - Connection pool usage
   - Storage usage

3. **User Metrics**
   - Active users
   - Feature usage
   - Conversion rates

### Alerting Setup
Configure alerts for:
- Application errors > 5%
- Response time > 5s
- Database CPU > 80%
- Storage > 90% full
- Failed authentication attempts > 10/min

## üîí Security Maintenance

### Regular Security Tasks
1. **Monthly Security Review**
   - Run security scanner
   - Review access logs
   - Check for suspicious activity
   - Update security policies

2. **Quarterly Security Audit**
   - Full penetration testing
   - Code security review
   - Access control audit
   - Third-party security assessment

### Security Incident Response
1. **Immediate Response**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Assess impact and scope
   - Notify stakeholders
   - Begin containment

2. **Investigation**
   - Collect evidence
   - Analyze attack vectors
   - Document findings
   - Implement fixes

3. **Recovery**
   - Restore from clean backups
   - Apply security patches
   - Update security measures
   - Monitor for reoccurrence

## üíæ Backup and Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- **Database**: Daily automated backups via Supabase
- **Files**: Automated backup of user uploads
- **Configuration**: Version controlled infrastructure as code
- **Retention**: 30 days for daily, 12 months for monthly

### Recovery Procedures
1. **Database Recovery**
   ```bash
   # Point-in-time recovery via Supabase dashboard
   # Or restore from specific backup
   ```

2. **Application Recovery**
   - Redeploy from Git repository
   - Restore environment variables
   - Verify functionality

## üîÑ Update Procedures

### Application Updates
1. **Development Process**
   - Create feature branch
   - Test in development environment
   - Code review and approval
   - Deploy to staging

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Schedule maintenance window
   - Deploy to production
   - Run post-deployment tests
   - Monitor for issues

### Dependency Updates
- Review security advisories weekly
- Test updates in staging environment
- Prioritize security patches
- Document breaking changes

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization
```sql
-- Common optimization queries
ANALYZE;
REINDEX;

-- Monitor slow queries
SELECT query, mean_time, calls 
FROM pg_stat_statements 
ORDER BY mean_time DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

### Application Optimization
- Monitor bundle size and loading times
- Implement code splitting where appropriate
- Optimize images and assets
- Use proper caching headers

## üö® Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
1. **High Response Times**
   - Check database query performance
   - Review network latency
   - Verify CDN configuration

2. **Authentication Issues**
   - Verify Supabase Auth configuration
   - Check JWT token expiration
   - Review CORS settings

3. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Check connection pool limits
   - Review database load
   - Verify network connectivity
